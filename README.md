## SUMMARY

Name: Shane Morris

C++ program that uses provided traces to measure the
accuracy of various dynamic branch predictors 

## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS

## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS
The logic behind the 2 bit bimodal predictor was particularly interesting. Using bit manipulations on the current branch value and the current state to determine whether or not the current prediciton was correct took a while to think through but ended up working very nicely. I continued to use this bit manipulation for the remained of the project.
